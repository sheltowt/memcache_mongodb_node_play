# Express Extension to Accept [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/express-extension-to-accept.png)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/express-extension-to-accept)

Convert URL file extensions to an accept header so you can defer file extension logic from your router to content negotiation.
For example, instead of supporting `/thing.html` and `/thing.json`,
you can just handle `/thing`.
This also improves caching most CDNs ignore `Vary: Accept`.

## API

### ExpToAccept(formats[])

`formats` is an array of extensions to support.

```js
var app = require('express')()

app.use(require('express-extension-to-accept')[
  'html',
  'htm',
  'json'
])

app.get('/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  get(req.params.id, function (req, thing) {
    res.format({
      html: function () {
        res.locals.thing = thing
        res.render('layout')
      },
      json: function () {
        res.send(thing)
      }
    })
  })
})
```
